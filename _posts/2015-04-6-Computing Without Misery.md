### Domain Specific Language
Designing General purpose programming language for mass tend to be obscure task and so is porting it to specific architecture. The interesting part of 
compiler comes with designing a domain specific language.
Past few weeks we have been busy designing DSL for Matrices. Intent is to create simplified representation for understanding computation while not losing
performance due to abstractions.

		
###CELL - My First Encounter with DSL 
This was toy interpreter for spreadsheet designed to understand concepts from programming language class.
This language supported arithmetic functions and macros just like Excel.
