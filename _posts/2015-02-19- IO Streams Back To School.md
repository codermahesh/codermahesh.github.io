title: IO Streams Back To School
---

 Just a Helping note on IOStream because ppl are too lazy to learn, write and share (for free!, you codeholes). 
 POST DOES NOT DESCRIBE API!

 
### Basic C style IO and IO-library
C style IO    includes low level functions such as open(2), read(2), write(2) etc.
Directly  Writes to  file buffer for file described by file descriptor.
IO-library    includes wrapper functions fprintf,printf,vsprintf which do formatting.



* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### C++ IO Streams



* Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via **â˜°** link in top corner
* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes), available via `<body>` classes

TAKE AWAY
* IO Library are built upon Language Specification and are not part of language itself!
* Use Your OWN head to mock every usecase!
* Make No Implicit Assumptions when it come to performance
* CPUs in assumption must be Multicore.
* Design your OWN library for your TASK!
