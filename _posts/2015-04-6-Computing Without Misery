### Domain Specific Language
Designing General purpose programming language for mass tend to obscure task and so is porting it to specific architecture. The interesting part of

Past few weeks we have been busy designing DSL for Matrices  and Machine Learning. Intent is to create simplified representation
for understanding computation.
